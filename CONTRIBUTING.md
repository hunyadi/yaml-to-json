## Prerequisites

Compiling this project requires [Emscripten](https://emscripten.org/), the LLVM-based compiler to produce Wasm. Detailed instructions on how to install `emcc`/`em++` are available in the [Getting started](https://emscripten.org/docs/getting_started/downloads.html) guide. We use *Installation instructions using the emsdk (recommended)*.

The project also depends on [Rapid YAML](https://github.com/biojppm/rapidyaml) but the amalgamated header file `src/ryml_all.hpp` has been pushed to the repository. This can be re-generated by running a Python script in the cloned `rapidyaml` repository:

```sh
python3 ./tools/amalgamate.py
```

## Building the project

Build the project with its `Makefile`:

```sh
make all
```

This will produce JavaScript output and Snowflake UDF definitions in the folder `dist`.

## Executing unit tests

Verify correctness by running unit tests with

```sh
node test.js
```

If any assertion fails, an error will be raised.
